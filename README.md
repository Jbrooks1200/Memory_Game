# Memory_Game
This is my final project for Udacity's IPND

<h2>How I built this Memory Game</h2>

I built this Memory Game by modifing the HTML and adding some style to the CSS.
I also used Javascript and jQuery to add functionality to the game.
The font-awesome bootstrap was used as well.
A winning modal was added that pops-up at the end with the stats of the game.
